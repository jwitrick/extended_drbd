= Description:
This cookbook is designed to setup and configure a pair of server with
drbd.
Please Note: this cookbook does not mount the drbd drive.

This cookbook can be used in the following situations:

1) Fresh server pair installation (please see below for how to use).

2) Adding a server to another server running drbd.

3) Change drbd.conf file and have drbd update with out restarting.


== How to use when creating a fresh server pair:

Prerequisites:

- Chef client must be installed on both servers.

- The disk location (node[:drbd][:disk]) must exist.

- The servers MUST be able to ssh to the other server.

Note: In order for this work properly both servers need to be running chef
at the same time,

You will need to have the following attribute values specified:

node[:drbd][:primary][:fqdn] and node[:drbd][:remote_host]


Once one server has been specified as drbd master you can add the recipe
"drbd::drbd_fresh_install" to the run_list of both servers.

== How to use when adding a new server to another server running drbd:

This is the same as above except the new server is not specified as the drbd
master, and you dont have to be running chef-client on the other server.

== How to use when changing the drbd.conf file:

On which ever server you are updated (or both) add the recipe
"drbd::drbd_inplace_upgrade" to the server's run_list. And the next
time Chef-client runs it will preform the changes in a safe way.

The ways I have used this have been to call this drbd cookbook from within
another cookbook, and have the second cookbook do the logic of decided whether
or not this is a fresh install or inplace upgrade.

Here is how I use it:

 if system(" [ -f /etc/drbd.conf ] ")
    include_recipe "extended_drbd::drbd_inplace_upgrade"
 else
    include_recipe "extended_drbd::drbd_fresh_install"
 end
